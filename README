This is an improved version of EyeFiServer, a program that receives
photos from your Eye-Fi card in your camera.

INSTALLATION OF THE SOFTWARE
----------------------------

You have two options:

* Fedora / Red Hat systems: `make rpm` in the source directory, then
  install (`rpm -Uvh`) the resulting `noarch` RPM in said directory.
* Others: `make install`.  See the `Makefile` for control options.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

You have two options.  You can run the server as part of your regular user
session (started automatically when you log in), or you can run it every
time your computer starts.  The first option is what we call a *user session*
setup, and the second one is a *system wide* setup.

For the user session setup, all you have to do is run *Eye-Fi preferences*
right from your preferred desktop environment.  If it doesn't appear in the
menus, then you can run the program `eyefiserver-prefs` and it will let you
set up your computer to receive photos from your Eye-Fi whenever you are
logged into your computer.

For the system session setup:

* If you are using the RPM installation (described above), you need to add
  your upload key to `/etc/eyefiserver.conf`, then enable and restart the
  `eyefiserver.service` service unit.  You can see the log in real-time
  using `journalctl -fa`.  Instructions on how to retrieve the upload key
  from your Windows or Mac OS X system are below.
* If you are *not* using the RPM installation (that is, you installed using
  `make` or by manually copying files to their right locations), then
  you need to set up:
  * the initscript by hand,
  * the permissions on the `/etc/eyefiserver.conf` configuration file,
  * the contents of that file,
  * the creation of the upload directory, and its permissions.


THE INFAMOUS UPLOAD KEY
-----------------------

To retrieve the upload key, you need to pair your Eye-Fi with the
Eye-Fi Center (which you can currently on do only
on Windows or Mac).  Do not enable Relayed Transfer during the
pairing process.

Once the pairing process is done, you must retrieve the key:

On Windows:
 See C:\Documents and Settings\<User>\Application Data\Eye-Fi\Settings.xml
On Mac:
 See ~/Applications Data/Eye-Fi/Settings.xml

If you are doing a *user session* setup, you can supply the key to the
preferences program `eyefiserver-prefs`.  If you are doing a *system wide*
setup, then you must search for `upload_key` in `/etc/eyefiserver.conf`
and then paste the key there.  Of course, the server needs to be
restarted after editing that file.

See manual for a full description of options.


MAN PAGES
---------
Man pages can be generated using txt2man utility:
txt2man -t eyefiserver -r "eyefiserver 2.3" -s 1 -v "Executable programs or shell commands" -I file doc/eyefiserver.txt > doc/eyefiserver.1
txt2man -t eyefiserver.conf -r "eyefiserver 2.3" -s 5 -v "File formats and conventions" doc/eyefiserver.conf.txt > doc/eyefiserver.conf.5
